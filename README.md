# AgroUSSD – Agricultural Marketplace via USSD
AgroUSSD is a console-based simulation of a USSD platform that directly connects Nigerian farmers and buyers. It provides real-time market price information, reduces dependence on middlemen, and empowers farmers with fair pricing opportunities using only basic mobile technology. This project presents the development of AgroUSSD, a simple agricultural information and trading system that leverages USSD technology to address market inefficiencies in Nigerian agriculture.

## 🚀 Features
-Farmer Registration & Profiles → Farmers can sign up, store personal details, and showcase available crops.
-Product Management → Farmers can add, update, and delete their produce data (price, quantity, type).
-Buyer Access → Buyers can search for available products and connect directly with farmers.
-Market Price Transparency → Displays current produce prices across multiple locations.
-Direct Farmer–Buyer Connection → Removes middlemen, ensuring fair pricing for both sides.
-Data Persistence with JSON → Farmers, traders, and product data are stored in JSON files for easy access and updates.
-Simple USSD Simulation → Console-based interface that mimics real USSD interactions.
