# AgroUSSD â€“ Agricultural Marketplace via USSD
AgroUSSD is a console-based simulation of a USSD platform that connects Nigerian farmers and buyers directly. It provides real-time market price information, reduces dependence on middlemen, and empowers farmers with fair pricing opportunities using only basic mobile technology. This project presents the development of AgroUSSD, a simple agricultural information and trading system that leverages USSD technology to address market inefficiencies in Nigerian agriculture.
